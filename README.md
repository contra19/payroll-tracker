# Employee Payroll Tracker

## A web application to track employee name's and salaries 

## Description

The Employee Payroll Tracker is a fun novelty web application that is used to track employee names and salaries. The names will remain saved in memory and on screen until the page refreshes as this is not intended to be used as a persistent tracker. 

The application is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The majority of the code is in JavaScript. JavaScript was the main focus in this application as this is a project to practice JavaScript for a class that I am taking. Our goal was to correct code and make the application functional.  

## Useage

The Employee Payroll Tracker does not need to be installed and can be found at https://contra19.github.io/payroll-tracker/. Once on the page the application is ready to use. 

When entering the app the user is presented with a blank employee roster and and "Add Employees" button.

The user will click the "Add Employees" button and will be prompted to add information for each employee.

Once the button is clicked, the user is presented with a prompt box that will ask for the employee's first name. To record the data, the user will need to either click 'OK' or press 'ENTER'.

After entering the employee's first name the user will get another prompt box asking for last name. After entering the last name the last prompt box will ask for the user salary. The final prompt will ask the user if they would like to add another employee. The user can add another employee by clicking on 'OK' or stop adding employee's by clicking 'Cancel'

The user can continue to add as many employees as they wish. Once finished entering users the user will see a list of employess sorted alphabetically by last name.

Some functional decisions I made for specific user actions are:
- If the user enters a first name or last name that is not capitalized, the application will automatically capitalize the first letter of the name. 
- If a blank first name and blank last name are provided for the same employee, the employee WILL NOT be recorded. 
- If a non-numeric salary or a blank salary are entered the application will convert the salary to a 0 value.

Easter Eggs
Some Easter Eggs that you will be able to find when you open the browser console:
- Average employee salary is calculated
- A message about our random drawing winner!

## Credits
Since this was a project for class, starter code was provided by Xander Rapstein(Xandromus) at https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/curly-potato. This code was used as the primer to get the framework of this project in place. Only the JavaScript code was altered. No changes were made to the HTML or CSS files. 

All original code was written under the collectEmployees, displayAverageSalary and getRandomEmployees functions. These functions were generated by looking at example code for the concepts used. The code was run through AI(chatGPT) to validate.
